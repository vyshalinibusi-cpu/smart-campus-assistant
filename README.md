💡 How It Works

The chatbot listens to user input and replies based on keyword matching.
For example:

"schedule" → "Class schedules are available on the campus portal."

"library" → "Library is open from 8 AM to 8 PM, Monday to Saturday."

"dining" → "Dining hall serves breakfast (7-10 AM), lunch (12-2 PM), and dinner (7-9 PM)."

"sports" → "Sports facilities include football, basketball, cricket, and indoor games."

"wifi" → "Free Wi-Fi is available across the campus. Contact IT helpdesk for login."

"admin" → "For administrative procedures, please visit the Registrar’s office."

Default reply:
👉 "I didn't understand that. Please ask about schedules, facilities, dining, library, or admin."
